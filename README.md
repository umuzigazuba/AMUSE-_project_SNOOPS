Short Description:
------------
	The formation of a second stellar population in a globular cluster after a collision with a molecular cloud

General Concepts:
------------
	We simulate the head-on collision of a metal-poor globular cluster with a certain velocity, and a dense, metal-rich molecular cloud. 
	During the collision, the accretion of material from the molecular cloud by stars is ascertained.
	By studying the amount of accreted mass, which is coupled to an increase in metallicty, we verify our hypothesis.  

Grade requirements:
---------------
- Minimum passing grade:
	- Main goal: Send a globular cluster, saved in a sink particle set, through a molecular cloud and observe the mass accretion. Do this by bridging the gravity code of the cluster and the hydrodynamics code of the cloud. Compare the results to real observations of clusters with multiple stellar populations. 
		- Done
	
	- Plot the amount of accreted mass as a function of time for the individual stars as they passing through the cloud. (dM VS T)
		- Done

	- Plot a histogram of the final amount of accreted mass. Compare to the amount of mass accretion needed to observe multiple stellar populations. (dM VS N(dM))
		- Done

- Bouns points:
	- Repeat the experiment for different velocities and impact parameters and analyse its effect on the mass accretion.
		- Done for different velocities
	
	- Add a stellar evolution code and analyse its effect on the mass accretion. Especially the effect of stellar dynamics, e.g. wind preventing accretion.
		- Done
