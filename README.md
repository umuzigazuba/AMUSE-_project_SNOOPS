Short Description:
------------
The formation of a second generation of stars in a globular cluster after a collision with a molecular cloud

General Concepts:
------------
	We simulate the collision of a globular cluster with a certain velocity and inclination, and a dense molecular cloud that is actively forming stars, 
	in the Galactic disk. We are interested in the formation mechanism of a second generation of stars in the globular cluster. 

Experimental setup:
------------

- Fixed parameters: mass and density for cluster and cloud

- Free parameters: impact parameters and velocity (change one at a time)

- Simulate for free fall time scale + ~2Myr years post collision
	Star formation detection
	Check if there are any new stars bound to the cluster 
	Optionally: see if mass is accreted to the first generation of stars
		Are they rejuvenated?
